        <p>The <strong>McNuggets</strong> are a staple of the <em>McDonalds</em> menu. They are essentially just pieces of white chicken meat cooked into (you guessed it) nuggets!</p>
        <p>To make them, just follow the ingredients list and steps below</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ground chicken</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Cornstarch</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Onion powder</li>
            <li>Garlic Powder</li>
            <li>Paprika</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a food processor or mixer, blend the chicken, 1 egg and salt until chicken
                resembles a paste.</li>
            <li>Dredge the nuggets in cornstarch until fully coat. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, mix the flour, seasonings, 1 egg and water. Mix well until a smooth batter forms.</li>
            <li>Place a nugget onto a fork. This will make it easy to dip into the batter.</li>
            <li>Dip it into the batter. Let excess batter drip off</li>
            <li>In a saucepan or deep skillet, bring oil to 350Â°F.
                Working in batches of 5, fry nuggets for 3 minutes or until nuggets are floating.</li>
            <li>Remove nuggets with a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel lined plate for 1 minute.
                Continue until all nuggets are done.
                Return nuggets to oil for 2 more minutes to double fry.</li>
            <li>Allow nuggets to slightly cool before eating.</li>
        </ol>
